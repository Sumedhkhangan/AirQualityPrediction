# AirQualityPrediction


🌍 Excited to share my latest project: Real-Time Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction System!

🔬 Project Highlights:
• Developed an end-to-end machine learning solution using LSTM neural networks
• Predicts AQI values for the next 4 hours with real-time data integration
• Built an interactive web application using Streamlit
• Integrated OpenWeatherMap API for current air quality data
• Comprehensive analysis of multiple pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3)

🛠️ Tech Stack:
• Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras
• Backend: Python, Scikit-learn
• Frontend: Streamlit
• Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
• API Integration: REST APIs

💡 Key Features:
• Real-time air quality monitoring
• 4-hour ahead predictions
• Interactive visualization
• Multi-city support
• Health category classification

🎯 Impact:
This project aims to help communities make informed decisions about outdoor activities and take necessary precautions based on predicted air quality levels.
